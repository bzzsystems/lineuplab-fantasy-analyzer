# ESPN API Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the ESPN Fantasy Football API integration for the Fantasy Football Season Analyzer. The integration provides secure access to ESPN's private league data, enabling users to analyze their fantasy football decisions and optimize their lineup strategies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: ESPN Authentication

**User Story:** As a fantasy football manager, I want to securely connect my ESPN league so that I can analyze my team's performance data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN credentials are valid THEN the system SHALL store them securely for the session
3. WHEN credentials are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
4. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL return basic league information (name, current week)
5. IF credentials expire during use THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 2: League Data Retrieval

**User Story:** As a fantasy football manager, I want to access my league's complete information so that I can see team standings and competitive context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting league information THEN the system SHALL return all team data including wins, losses, points for/against
2. WHEN processing team data THEN the system SHALL handle both string and object owner formats safely
3. WHEN returning league data THEN the system SHALL include current standings sorted by wins and points
4. WHEN league data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. IF league access is restricted THEN the system SHALL verify user membership

### Requirement 3: Team Roster Analysis

**User Story:** As a fantasy football manager, I want to retrieve detailed roster information for any team and week so that I can analyze lineup decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting team roster data THEN the system SHALL return complete player information including names, positions, and stats
2. WHEN processing roster data THEN the system SHALL categorize players into lineup and bench groups
3. WHEN retrieving weekly stats THEN the system SHALL include both actual and projected points
4. WHEN roster data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL handle missing data gracefully
5. IF team ID is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error

### Requirement 4: Matchup Data Access

**User Story:** As a fantasy football manager, I want to access historical matchup data so that I can analyze game outcomes and scoring patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting matchup data for a specific week THEN the system SHALL return all games for that week
2. WHEN processing matchup data THEN the system SHALL include home/away team IDs and final scores
3. WHEN matchup data spans multiple weeks THEN the system SHALL filter by the requested week
4. WHEN no matchups exist for a week THEN the system SHALL return an empty array
5. IF week parameter is invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate validation errors

### Requirement 5: Server Health and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the ESPN API integration health so that I can ensure reliable service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking server health THEN the system SHALL return uptime, request count, and authentication status
2. WHEN monitoring API performance THEN the system SHALL log request timing and success rates
3. WHEN ESPN API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return 502 status with clear error messages
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies
5. IF server resources are low THEN the system SHALL provide early warning indicators

### Requirement 6: Session Management

**User Story:** As a fantasy football manager, I want my authentication to persist during my analysis session so that I don't need to re-enter credentials repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user authenticates successfully THEN the system SHALL maintain session state
2. WHEN making subsequent API calls THEN the system SHALL use stored credentials automatically
3. WHEN user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored credentials
4. WHEN session becomes inactive THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
5. IF multiple users access the system THEN sessions SHALL be isolated (future requirement)

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a fantasy football manager, I want clear error messages when something goes wrong so that I can understand and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESPN API returns errors THEN the system SHALL translate them to user-friendly messages
2. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return 400 status with validation details
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL distinguish between invalid credentials and expired sessions
5. IF system errors occur THEN detailed logs SHALL be available for debugging

### Requirement 8: Data Format Standardization

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent data formats from the ESPN API integration so that I can build reliable user interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning team data THEN the system SHALL use consistent field names (teamId, teamName, ownerName)
2. WHEN processing player data THEN the system SHALL convert ESPN position IDs to readable names
3. WHEN handling missing data THEN the system SHALL provide default values rather than null/undefined
4. WHEN returning arrays THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent ordering (standings by wins/points)
5. IF data transformation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and return partial data when possible
